# DiabetesPrediction
This project is a web-based application designed to help patients and healthcare providers manage diabetes effectively. The system allows users to record and track health parameters such as blood sugar levels, insulin intake, diet, exercise, and medication schedules.
Developed a machine learning–based web application that predicts the likelihood of diabetes in a user based on key medical and lifestyle parameters. The system uses a trained classification model to analyze inputs such as glucose level, blood pressure, BMI, age, insulin level, and other relevant health indicators to provide an accurate risk assessment.

The application features an intuitive and user-friendly interface where users can securely enter their health data and instantly receive prediction results. The backend integrates data preprocessing, feature scaling, and a trained machine learning model to ensure reliable and consistent predictions. Emphasis was placed on model accuracy, robustness, and real-time inference.

This project demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in healthcare, highlighting skills in data analysis, model training and evaluation, backend integration, and full-stack web development. The solution aims to promote early detection and awareness of diabetes, helping users take preventive measures or seek medical consultation at an early stage.
